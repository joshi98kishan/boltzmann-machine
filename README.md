# boltzmann-machine

[Work In Progress! ðŸš§]

Understanding the working of boltzmann machine (BM). This repo contains the code for a blog which will be published here (probably next month): [joshi98kishan.github.io](https://joshi98kishan.github.io).

`boltzmann_machine.py` contains the code for Boltzmann Machine.

Experiments:
- exp 1, `bm_exp1_parity_problem` notebook contains code to train BM for parity problem. It is messy in the current state, need to clean it.
- exp 2, encoder problem:
    - 4-2-4 encoder: check `bm_424_encoder` notebook (yet to make it clean).
    - 8-3-8 encoder (under progress)
    
- exp 3 will be on shifter problem.

All these experiments are taken from [extended paper](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/bmtr.pdf) on BM. Here I am trying to reproduce the results in the paper.
