# boltzmann-machine

[Work In Progress! ðŸš§]

Understanding the working of boltzmann machine (BM). This repo contains the code for a blog which will be published here (probably next month): [joshi98kishan.github.io](https://joshi98kishan.github.io).

Experiments:
- `bm_exp1_parity_problem` notebook contains code to train BM for parity problem. It is messy in the current state, need to clean it.
- exp 2 (under progress) is on encoder problem.
- exp 3 will be on shifter problem.

All these experiments are taken from [extended paper](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/bmtr.pdf) of BM.
